- Example of a WCF call accessing a database with a stored proc, and using an ObjectCache to cache the results. 
The WCF endpoints return ASP.NET DataSet types.

- ObjectCache implemented
- Two clients (web form and silverlight) show how to consume the service, with the silverlight client showing how
to deserialize the result which is returned as an ArrayOfXElement type.
